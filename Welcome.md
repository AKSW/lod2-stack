#### Silk ####

"The Silk Link Discovery Framework supports data publishers in accomplishing the second task. Using the declarative Silk - Link Specification Language (Silk-LSL), developers can specify which types of RDF links should be discovered between data sources as well as which conditions data items must fulfill in order to be interlinked. These link conditions may combine various similarity metrics and can take the graph around a data item into account, which is addressed using an RDF path language. Silk accesses the data sources that should be interlinked via the SPARQL protocol and can thus be used against local as well as remote SPARQL endpoints. ... " (http://lod2.eu/Project/Silk)

#### PoolParty Extractor ####

"The PoolParty Extractor (PPX) offers an API providing text mining algorithms based on semantic knowledge models. With the PoolParty Extractor you can analyse documents in an automated fashion, extracting meaningful phrases, named entities, categories or other metadata. Different data or metadata schemas can be mapped to a SKOS thesaurus that is used as a unified semantic knowledge model."
