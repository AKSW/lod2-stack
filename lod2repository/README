This keyring is used as a trusted keyring for the LOD2 package
repository.

to modify the pubring.gpg try:
  gpg --homedir ./ --import xxx.asc
  (add a new maintainer key)
or
  gpg --homedir ./ --delete-key F27A1C8B
  (remove an old maintainer key)
in this directory.

after that, create a new package with
  make lod2repository

Workplan for key changes:

1. checkout / update this directory
2. add or replace a key under ./keys
   - *.asc are gpg keys (signing)
   - *.pub are ssh keys (dput)
3a. in case of ssh key changes:
   - run "make upload-keys"
3b. in case of gpg key changes:
   - add the key.asc to the database (e.g. gpg --homedir ./ --import keys/X.asc)
   - create a new package (make lod2repository)
   - upload it with dput
4. svn commit the changes
